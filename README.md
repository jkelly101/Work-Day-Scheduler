# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this project I created a Work Day Scheduler which allows the user to enter their plans into one hour timeblocks from 9AM to 5PM. The planner will highlight each timeblock to show whether it is in the past, present or future.

##  Motivation

To keep more organized and motivated throughout the work day and to keep on task.

### Using get Date()
